    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is a typical dish from Ceará and much appreciated throughout the
      Northeast and North of Brazil. It basically consists of a preparation that
      takes rice, mixed with beans (usually green beans), crackling and curd
      cheese. It is also common to add bottled butter to finish the dish, giving
      it a unique, delicious flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you are a vegan, you know not to add ingredients of animal
      origin. How to make a vegan baião de dois? Well, obviously you shouldn't
      add curd cheese, crackling or bottled butter, which is derived from cow's
      milk cream. As a substitute, you can use assorted vegetables, tofu,
      plant-based butter, or olive oil for texture.
