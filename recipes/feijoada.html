    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There are stories about the invention of Feijoada that slaves in Brazil
      added the remains of meat that had been sorted out by their owners to
      their beloved black beans. However, there is no historical evidence for
      this and presumably pig’s nose, tail, feet and innards were more of an
      expensive delicacy at that time, which were not thrown away even by the
      richest people. So it is more likely that slaves had to cook this dish for
      their owners.

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <h3>Vegan Feijoada</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Put the black beans in a bowl, cover them generously with water and let
        them soak for at least 8 hours or overnight. Drain before further use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the beans with 1.25 l of water (without salt!) in a large saucepan
        and bring to a boil. Skim off the resulting foam. Add the bay leaves and
        simmer everything with the lid on for approx. 90 - 100 minutes at low to
        medium temperature until the beans are cooked but still have a nice
        bite.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the meantime, cut the smoked tofu, paprika sausage, sweet potato and
        mushrooms into bite-size pieces. Finely chop the onion and garlic. Fry
        the smoked tofu and sausage ​​in a large pan with a generous dash of
        olive oil at medium to high temperature. As soon as they turn brownish
        add mushrooms, sweet potato, onion and garlic. Fry for another 2-3
        minutes. Season with soy sauce, paprika powder and liquid smoke.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the hand blender to go into the beans and briefly puree a small part
        of the beans so that the stew becomes creamier. Add the contents of the
        pan to the beans and let everything simmer for about another 15 minutes
        without a lid until the sweet potato is cooked through. To do this,
        raise the temperature slightly. Season well with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve feijoada with farofa, fried leafy green vegetables, rice and
        orange slices.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Farofa</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Finely chop cashews, raisins, onions and garlic. Sauté briefly with
        olive oil in a pan at medium temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cassava flour and stir-fry for about 2 minutes. Add chopped
        parsley and season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
